**Business Context Description:**

[cols="1,3" options="header"]
|===
| Neighbor | Description

| Software Architect
| Primary user who creates and maintains class diagrams representing system design. Expects visual modeling capabilities and code generation.

| Software Developer
| Primary user who writes and refactors code. Expects automatic diagram updates and ability to understand system structure visually.

| Version Control System
| External system (Git) where both diagram definitions and generated/synchronized code are stored for team collaboration and history tracking.

| IDE/Code Editor
| External development environment where developers write code. May integrate with the tool for enhanced workflow.

| Python Runtime
| External system used to validate syntax and semantics of generated Python code.

| Interface | Technology | Purpose

| Diagram Storage
| JSON/YAML or PlantUML text format
| Persistent storage of diagram definitions in version-controllable format

| Code Generation Output
| Python .py files
| Generated Python source code with classes, attributes, methods

| Code Parsing Input
| Python AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)
| Parse existing Python code to extract class structure

| User Interface
| Web-based (Electron) or Desktop GUI
| Interactive diagram editor and code viewer

| File System
| OS file system APIs
| Read/write diagram and code files, monitor changes

| Configuration
| TOML/YAML configuration files
| User preferences, code generation templates, synchronization rules
|===

**Data Flow:**

* *Diagram → Code*: User creates/modifies class diagram → Tool generates Python code → Code saved to file system
* *Code → Diagram*: User modifies Python code → Tool parses code → Diagram updated in real-time
* *Persistence*: Both diagram definitions and code committed to version control as text files
