== Introduction and Goals

This document describes the architecture of a Model-Driven Development Tool that enables software developers and architects to seamlessly work with visual class diagrams and auto-generated code with real-time bidirectional synchronization.

=== Requirements Overview

The system provides the following key capabilities:

* *Visual Class Diagram Editor*: Interactive drawing interface for creating and editing UML class diagrams
* *Code Generation*: Automatic Python code generation from class diagrams
* *Reverse Engineering*: Automatic class diagram generation from existing Python code
* *Real-time Synchronization*: Bidirectional live updates between diagrams and code
* *Developer Workflow Integration*: Seamless integration into software development processes

=== Quality Goals

[cols="1,2,2" options="header"]
|===
| Priority | Quality Goal | Motivation

| 1
| Real-time Performance
| Changes in diagrams or code must be reflected immediately (< 500ms) to maintain developer flow

| 2
| Accuracy
| Generated code must accurately reflect diagram structure and vice versa, maintaining semantic correctness

| 3
| Usability
| Intuitive interface for both architects (diagram-focused) and developers (code-focused)

| 4
| Extensibility
| Architecture should support adding more programming languages beyond Python

| 5
| Reliability
| No data loss during synchronization; conflict resolution when simultaneous changes occur
