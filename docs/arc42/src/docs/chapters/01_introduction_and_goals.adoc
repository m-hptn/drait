== Introduction and Goals

This document describes the architecture of a Model-Driven Development Tool that enables software developers and architects to seamlessly work with visual class diagrams and auto-generated code with real-time bidirectional synchronization.

NOTE: This architecture document describes the **target architecture** for the complete system. See the Implementation Status section below for the current state of development.

=== Implementation Status

The project is under active development. The following components are currently implemented:

*Completed:*

* ✅ *Core Metamodel* - Complete UML class diagram representation with JSON serialization
* ✅ *Python AST Parser* - Full code-to-model transformation including:
  - Class, attribute, and method extraction with visibility detection
  - Advanced type annotations (generics, Optional, Union)
  - Automatic relationship inference (inheritance, composition, aggregation, dependencies)
  - Support for abstract classes, decorators, properties, dataclasses, and protocols
  - Virtual environment exclusion (.venv, venv, etc.)
  - Deterministic UUID generation for persistent node identification
* ✅ *PlantUML Exporter* - Export metamodel to PlantUML diagrams
* ✅ *Desktop Application* (Electron + React + TypeScript):
  - Interactive diagram viewer with React Flow
  - Package visualization with resizable containers
  - Drag-and-drop node positioning
  - Layout persistence with auto-save (stored in `~/.drait/layouts/`)
  - File and folder import via IPC
  - Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)

*In Progress / Planned:*

* 🚧 *Code Generator* - Template-based Python code generation from metamodel (planned)
* 🚧 *Diagram Editor* - Add/remove/modify classes in UI (currently view-only)
* 🚧 *Synchronization Engine* - Bidirectional real-time sync (planned)
* 🚧 *File System Watchers* - Automatic change detection (planned)
* 🚧 *Conflict Resolution* - Handling simultaneous changes (planned)

The current implementation focuses on **reverse engineering** (code → diagram visualization) with interactive layout management. The full bidirectional synchronization described in this document represents the target architecture.

=== Requirements Overview

The system provides the following key capabilities:

* *Visual Class Diagram Editor*: Interactive drawing interface for creating and editing UML class diagrams
* *Code Generation*: Automatic Python code generation from class diagrams
* *Reverse Engineering*: Automatic class diagram generation from existing Python code
* *Real-time Synchronization*: Bidirectional live updates between diagrams and code
* *Developer Workflow Integration*: Seamless integration into software development processes

=== Quality Goals

[cols="1,2,2" options="header"]
|===
| Priority | Quality Goal | Motivation

| 1
| Real-time Performance
| Changes in diagrams or code must be reflected immediately (< 500ms) to maintain developer flow

| 2
| Accuracy
| Generated code must accurately reflect diagram structure and vice versa, maintaining semantic correctness

| 3
| Usability
| Intuitive interface for both architects (diagram-focused) and developers (code-focused)

| 4
| Extensibility
| Architecture should support adding more programming languages beyond Python

| 5
| Reliability
| No data loss during synchronization; conflict resolution when simultaneous changes occur
