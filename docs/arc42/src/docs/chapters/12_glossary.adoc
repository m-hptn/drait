| Term | Definition

| Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
| Tree representation of the syntactic structure of source code. Python's `ast` module provides facilities to parse Python code into AST format for programmatic analysis.

| Attribute
| A data member of a class representing state or properties. In UML, shown in the middle section of a class box.

| Bidirectional Transformation
| Transformation that can operate in both forward (model to code) and backward (code to model) directions while maintaining consistency.

| Class Diagram
| UML diagram type showing classes, their attributes, methods, and relationships. Primary diagram type supported by this tool.

| Code Generation
| Automatic creation of source code from higher-level models or specifications. In this context, generating Python code from UML class diagrams.

| Conflict Resolution
| Process of reconciling contradictory changes when both diagram and code are modified simultaneously.

| docToolchain
| Documentation build tool that processes AsciiDoc files and generates various output formats (HTML, PDF). Used to render this arc42 documentation.

| Electron
| Framework for building cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

| Event-Driven Architecture
| Software architecture pattern where components communicate through events rather than direct method calls.

| Forward Engineering
| Process of generating code from design models (diagram → code).

| Incremental Synchronization
| Updating only the changed elements rather than regenerating/reparsing entire diagrams or codebases.

| Inheritance
| Object-oriented programming concept where a class derives from another class. Represented in UML with hollow arrow pointing to superclass.

| Jinja2
| Template engine for Python, used in this tool for generating code from templates.

| Method
| Function or operation defined within a class. In UML, shown in the bottom section of a class box.

| Model-Driven Development (MDD)
| Software development approach emphasizing creation and use of abstract models throughout the development lifecycle.

| MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
| Architectural pattern separating data model, user interface, and presentation logic. Used in this tool's architecture.

| Relationship
| Connection between classes in UML, including association, aggregation, composition, and inheritance.

| Reverse Engineering
| Process of generating design models from existing code (code → diagram).

| Round-trip Engineering
| Ability to make changes in either model or code and have those changes reflected in the other representation.

| Serialization
| Process of converting data structures into a format that can be stored (e.g., JSON) and later reconstructed.

| Stereotype
| UML extension mechanism for creating new kinds of modeling elements. Examples: «interface», «abstract», «entity».

| Synchronization
| Process of keeping diagram and code representations consistent with each other.

| Template
| Pre-defined code structure with placeholders that are filled in during code generation.

| Type Hint
| Python syntax (introduced in 3.5) for indicating expected types of variables, parameters, and return values. Used extensively in generated code.

| UML (Unified Modeling Language)
| Standardized visual modeling language for software systems. ISO/IEC 19505 standard.

| Visibility
| Access control level for class members. In Python/UML: public (no prefix), protected (_prefix), private (__prefix).

| WYSIWYG
| "What You See Is What You Get" - interface where editing view directly represents final output. Applied to diagram editor in this tool.
